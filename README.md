# FHDL

Software programmers may never learn a hardware description languange(HDL). This is for various
reasons. The reason that is addressed with this project is that HDLs, while similar to "tradtional
programming languanges" (TPL), require a fundamentally different mindset to effectively use. This goal of this 
project is to develop a platform that acts as a middle ground between HDL and TPL. Being in between an
HDL and TPL means traditional programmers can learn how HDLs work while staying within familiar 
territory. The point is that learning HDLs should be much easier and seem less intimadating.
